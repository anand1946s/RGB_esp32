# RGB_esp32
My personal project which involved controlling the outputs of an RGB led using Pulse WIdth Modulation


I successfuly demonstrated the use of ultrasonic sensor in calulating the distance travelled and the distance at which the circuit is kept from a hard opaque object using PWM

To try the same
Connect the the wires appropriately as shown(we have used an esp32 for the project however the circuit diagram has been shown using an arduino module)
Run the .ino file as arduino code
